====================

Makes two 1-pound loaves, 18 dinner rolls, or 12 burger or hot dog buns

Sponge | _ | _
--- | --- | ---
2 1/2 cups | 11.25 ounces | unbleached bread flour
2 teaspoons | 0.22 ounce | instant yeast
1 1/4 cups | 12 ounces | whole milk, lukewarm (90F to 100F)

Dough | _ | _
--- | --- | ---
1 2/3 cups | 7.5 ounces | unbleached bread flour
1 1/2 teaspoons | 0.38 ounce | salt
3 tablespoons | 1.5 ounces | sugar
1 large | 0.65 ounces | egg yolk, slightly beaten, at room temperature
1/4 cup | 2 ounces | butter, margarine, or shortening, melted or at room temperature, or vegetable oil


Method
------

1. **To make the sponge, mix together the flour and yeast in a 4-quart bowl.** Stir in the milk until all the flour is hydrated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for 45 to 60 minutes, or until the sponge becomes aerated and frothy and swells noticeably.

2. **To make the dough, add the flour, salt, and sugar to the sponge.** Then add the egg yolk and butter or other fat. Mix with a large metal spoon or on low speed of the electric mixer with the paddle attachment until all the flour is absorbed and the dough forms a ball. If the dough seems very stiff and dry, trickle in more water until the dough is soft and supple.

3. **Sprinkle flour on the counter, transfer the dough to the counter**, and begin kneading (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook), adding more flour, if necessary, to reate a dough that is soft, supple, and tacky but not sticky. Continue kneading (or mixing) for 6 to 8 minutes (In the electric mixer, the dough should clear the sides of the bowl nut stick ever so slightly to the bottom.) The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 80F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

4. **Ferment at room temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 hours**, or until the dough doubles in size (the length of time will depend on the room temperature)/

5. **Remove the fermented dough from the bowl and divide it in half for sandwich loaves.** Shape the pieces into boules (Page 72 BBA) for loaves. Mist the dough lightly with spray oil and cover with a towel or plastic wrap. Allow to rest for about 20 minutes.

6. **For loaves, shape as shown on page 81 (BBA)**. Lightly oil two 8 1/2 by 4 1/2 inch loaf pans and place the loaves in the pans.

7. **Preheat the oven to 350F.** If you wish to garnish the loaves with poppy or sesame seeds, brush with an egg wash and do so. You may also score them down the center and rub a little vegetable oil in the cut for the classic sandwich bread look.

8. **Bake loaves for 35 to 45 minutes**, rotating 180 degrees halfway though for even baking, if needed. The tops should be golden brown and the sides when removed from the pan, should also be golden. The internal temperature of the loaves should be close to 190F, and the loaves should sound hollow when thumped on the bottom.

9. **When the loaves have finished baking**, remove them immediately from the pans and cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing or serving.
